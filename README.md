# Ruby-On-Rails-Website
A semester long Ruby on Rails website project.

This is a complete website from a Ruby on Rails class.  It covers the following:

A contact page.

A products page that demonstrates a one-to-many database relationship.  One product has many reviews.

An articles page.

A blogs page that demonstrates a one-to-many database relationship.  One blog has many ratings.  It is also attached to an emailer.

A calendar.

A preferences page that's attached to an emailer.

A log in option which gives admin privledges to the products and blogs pages. 

NOTE:  There may or may not be various issues viewing my project related to the IDE you're using.
